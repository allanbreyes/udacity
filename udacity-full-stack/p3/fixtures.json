      "description": "CS169.1x teaches the fundamentals for engineering long-lasting software using highly-productive Agile techniques to develop Software as a Service (SaaS) using Ruby on Rails. Students will understand the new challenges and opportunities of SaaS versus shrink-wrapped software. They will understand and apply fundamental programming techniques to the design, development, testing, and public cloud deployment of a simple SaaS application. Students will use best-of-breed tools that support modern development techniques including behavior-driven design, user stories, test-driven development, velocity, and pair programming. Students will learn how modern programming language features like metaprogramming and reflection can improve productivity and code maintainability. Students will work on weekly coding projects and quizzes. Those who successfully complete the assignments and earn a passing grade can get an honor code certificate or verified certificate from BerkeleyX. The videos and homeworks used in this offering of the course were revised in October 2013. The new class also includes embedded live chat with Teaching Assistants and other students and opportunities for remote pair programming with other students.",

In the first half of the course, CS 169.1x, students use Agile development methods to deploy a simple SaaS app in the cloud. In the second half, CS 169.2x, students create more sophisticated apps by adding relationships between models in apps and by enhancing their apps with JavaScript. They also learn about what happens after the apps are deployed to real users, including how to monitor performance, identify and fix common performance problems, and avoid compromising customer data. Finally, students learn how to apply Agile techniques to enhance and refactor legacy code, a critical skill for professional programmers.",

MIT has been asking its student entrepreneurs this question for many years – and with great success.  The 25,600 companies started by MIT alumni generate $2 trillion in revenue and have created 3.3 million jobs.  If MIT were a country, it would be the 11th largest economy in the world.  Become a citizen of this 11th largest economy!  Join MIT in your entrepreneurial journey as you discover your startups most essential resource – the customer.  This is entrepreneurship – so don't expect a lecture.  Every class session will be an in-depth and focused case study of MIT entrepreneurs from areas as diverse as mobile applications, 3D printing, power electronics, international development, and watchmaking.  You will learn, through the stories of MIT entrepreneurs, how to go from idea or technology to the necessary understanding of who and why will want to buy your product.",

In Entrepreneurship 101, you’ve learned to look at the world through the eyes of the customer – and ah, what a great perspective it is!  But the journey doesn’t stop there. For the holy grail of specificity – while already within reach – there is still much to learn before obtaining it.  Just as important as finding your customer is creating a great product that will solve the customer’s problem.  How will customers acquire your product?  How will it solve the customer’s problem? What value will your product bring?  What is your secret sauce?  How do you stack up vis-à-vis the competition?  From fields as diverse as virtual immortality, small business marketing, urban design, language education, healthcare, and entrepreneur support services, we use in-depth case studies of entrepreneurs to examine how they developed their product concepts, solved their customer’s problem, established a clear value proposition, refined their secret sauce, and understood their competition.  The journey continues.  Are you with us?  The customer is waiting. ",

We have chosen to focus on breadth rather than depth. The goal is to provide students with a brief introduction to many topics, so that they will have an idea of what’s possible when the time comes later in their career to think about how to use computation to accomplish some goal. That said, it is not a “computation appreciation” course. Students will spend a considerable amount of time writing programs to implement the concepts covered in the course. Topics covered include plotting, stochastic programs, probability and statistics, random walks, Monte Carlo simulations, modeling data, optimization problems, and clustering.",

      "description": "Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. In the past decade, machine learning has given us self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, effective web search, and a vastly improved understanding of the human genome. Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it. Many researchers also think it is the best way to make progress towards human-level AI. In this class, you will learn about the most effective machine learning techniques, and gain practice implementing them and getting them to work for yourself. More importantly, you'll learn about not only the theoretical underpinnings of learning, but also gain the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply these techniques to new problems. Finally, you'll learn about some of Silicon Valley's best practices in innovation as it pertains to machine learning and AI.  This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.",
