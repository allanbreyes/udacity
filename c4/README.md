# C^4 Chicago Coding Corners

## About
This single-page application displays a map of coding 'corners' in Chicago--venues where Meetups are hosted involving coding.  It uses the Meetup API to pull a list of open events involving coding, extracts the location data, and plots them on a map using the Google Maps API.  By clicking on the side bar list of 'coding corners,' or clicking on the markers on the map, an information window shows the venue name, address, and the title and dates of upcoming meetups.  Clicking on each meetup title will take you to the respective Meetup event information page, where you can sign up.
