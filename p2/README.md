#P2: Interactive Resume
##Project Overview

In this project you will write the JavaScript that powers your own interactive resume.

This project is meant to be completed while taking the Javascript Basics course. Throughout the course you'll build your resume by writing a JS script that will combine your personal information with pre-written HTML and CSS templates to generate your resume.

##Why this Project?

Once you've mastered the skills of a front end web developer you'll want to make a great first impression. You need a resume that stands out.

The resume you build will not only help you build important skills, but will also make it easy to show employers why you’re perfect for the job. As you progress through this nanodegree you can update this resume with your new skills and projects.

##What will I Learn?

You will learn basic JavaScript syntax, which includes manipulating data types (like JSON), building loops and creating functions. At the same time, you’ll learn some simple jQuery DOM manipulation methods to build your resume the moment a user opens your website.

##How does this Help my Career?
