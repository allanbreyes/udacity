Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision Trees** (DTs): DTs are my \"go to\" algorithm when first attacking a machine learning problem. DTs can be applied to data with non-linear trends and both numerical and categorical features. They're easy to interpret and they typically shed light on and inform other algorithms' design; specifically, features which tend to have high information gain might be candidates for boosting, while others for regularization. DTs are well-suited to handle feature interactions, are non-parametric, and are a great fit for binary classification (pass or fail). The main weakness of DTs is its tendency to overfit on the training set; cross-validation is critical!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Support Vector Machines** (SVMs): SVMs are linear classifiers, and are particularly apt for tasks that involve binary classification. Although they are a bit more complex to understand, they perform admirably when the dataset is small--a perfect fit for our student dataset. A major strength for SVMs are its high accuracy and robustness towards overfitting (due to regularization). However, while kernel selection provides incredible advantages in introducing domain expertise and knowledge, it also presents a challenge for tuning and improvement of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Random Forests** (RFs): RFs are ensemble learning methods suited for both classification and regression, and build off of the previously stated shortcomings of DTs. RFs tend to be incredibly accurate and easy to tune, but also tend to be computationally-expensive. However, its reliance on randomization yields non-deterministic results. I chose to utilize RFs after seeing the preliminary results from the earlier DT algorithm (#1). Given the small dataset size and small feature set, I did not anticipate significant computation time."

    "**Answer: ** The final F1 score for a grid search-optimized Random Forest classifier for training and testing were  1.0 and 0.8689, a marginal improvement over the original model. I searched over the number of estimators, max features, and max depth; however, its computation time grew unreasonably when including other parameters. Given more resources and tuning of hyperparameters, its reasonable to expect increased, but marginal gains in F1 score performance."
