# Project 2: Supervised Learning
## Building a Student Intervention System

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

Udacity recommends our students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), i pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the notebook `student_intervention.ipynb` notebook file. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `student_intervention/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook student_intervention.ipynb```  
```jupyter notebook student_intervention.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
