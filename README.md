  fit bike-sharing data
- **p2** - Image Classification: classifying images from the **CIFAR-10**
  dataset using a convnet
- **p3** - Generate TV Scripts: generating scripts using recurrent neural
  networks
- **p4** - Translate a Language: language translation with recurrent neural
  networks
- **p5** - Generate Faces: using generative adversarial networks to generate
  realistic faces
