#P3: Classic Arcade Game Clone
##Project Overview

You will be provided visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

##Why this Project?

Games have a lot of objects and those object do a lot of different things; but sometimes those object do some very similar things as well. This creates a great opportunity to practice object-oriented programming, an important programming paradigm that influences your application architecture as well as provides performance optimizations.

##What will I Learn?

You will learn JavaScript’s object oriented programming features to write eloquently designed classes capable of creating countless instances of similarly functioning objects. You will discover a variety of ways inheritance and delegation can be used to create well architected and performant applications.

##How does this Help my Career?

- JavaScript enables the development of complex applications on the web.
- JavaScript runs on normal web browsers, which makes it one of the most accessible and flexible programming languages.
- Complex applications that must be “broken down” into simpler entities that manage their own properties and functionality
